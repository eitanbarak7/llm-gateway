I believe that everyone should eat breakfast\nbefore going to their activities. The purpose of this paper is to show the importance of\nbreakfast, especially for students. THESIS STATEMENT\nThe first reason why you should eat breakfast before going to school is for your\nhealth. When you skip breakfast and go to school, you are looking for a disease because\nit\u2019s not healthy to have an empty stomach all day long. It\u2019s very important to have a\nmeal and not let your stomach work empty. All you are going to get is gastritis and a lot\nof problems with your health if you don\u2019t eat breakfast.\nAnother reason for eating breakfast is because you need food for to do well in\nyour classes. You body and your brain are not going to function as good as they could\nbecause you have no energy and no strength. When you try to learn something and have\nnothing in your stomach, you are going to have a lot of trouble succeeding. A lot of\npeople think that they should not eat because they are going to feel tired, but that\u2019s not\ntrue. Breakfast is not a very big meal, and on the contrary, you\u2019re going to feel tired if\nyou don\u2019t have breakfast because you have spent the entire previous night without\nfood.\nThe last reason to have breakfast every day is because you can avoid diseases if\nyou eat some breakfast in the morning. If you don\u2019t eat, you are going to get sick, and\nthese diseases will have a stronger effect on you because you\u2019re going to get sick easier\nthan people who have breakfast every day.\nYou have to realize that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and you\ncannot skip it without consequences for your health, your school and your defense\nmechanism. It is better to wake up earlier and have a good breakfast that run to school\n2\nwithout eating anything. It is time for you to do something for your health, and eating\nbreakfast is the better way to start your day.
